# Changelog

All notable changes to the MS SQL Manager extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Connection Toolbar Color — Visual connection identification**
  - New optional **Toolbar Color** setting in the connection form allows assigning a custom color to each connection.
  - When a colored connection is active, the SQL Editor toolbar displays a colored top border, making it easy to visually distinguish between environments (e.g. red for production, green for dev).
  - Color picker with hex input and enable/disable checkbox in the connection dialog.
  - Default behavior unchanged — connections without a color use the standard VS Code theme toolbar appearance.
  - Color persists with the connection configuration and is restored when editing an existing connection.

### Tests

- Added **8** unit tests for Toolbar connection color rendering: no color (default), custom color applied, null connection, multiple connections, connection without color, status labels.
- Added **8** unit tests for ConnectionConfig color field: serialization, undefined handling, webview mapping, save/load logic.

## [0.19.13] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **New Query — Now prompts to save unsaved changes on close**
  - "New Query" (untitled queries) now open as VS Code untitled documents through the custom SQL editor, instead of raw webview panels.
  - Closing an untitled query that has been edited now shows VS Code's native "Do you want to save the changes?" dialog with Save / Don't Save / Cancel options.
  - Save triggers a Save As dialog to pick a `.sql` file location, then continues editing in the custom editor.
  - Empty untitled queries (no content typed) can still be closed without a prompt.
  - Auto-execute and query history info are preserved when opening untitled queries from tree commands.

## [0.19.12] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — Unsaved changes detection (dirty state) now works for `.sql` files**
  - Editing SQL content in the custom SQL Editor webview did not mark the underlying document as modified, so VS Code never showed the "Do you want to save changes?" dialog when closing a file with unsaved edits.
  - Root cause: the React webview sends a `contentChanged` message when the Monaco editor content changes, but the extension host only handled the `documentChanged` message type — the content change was silently dropped and the `TextDocument` was never updated.
  - Fix: added `onChange` handler to the Monaco editor component that posts `contentChanged` to the extension on every edit, and added `contentChanged` as a recognized message type in the extension host (both file-backed and untitled query paths).
  - Added echo-suppression guard to prevent the `onDidChangeTextDocument` → `update` round-trip from bouncing content back to the webview after each keystroke.

- **SQL Editor — "Webview is disposed" error on close**
  - Closing a SQL Editor tab could throw `Error: Webview is disposed` when a pending document-change event tried to post a message to the already-disposed webview.
  - Added a disposed-webview guard in the `onDidChangeTextDocument` listener to silently skip the update when the webview is no longer alive.

## [0.19.11] - 2026-05-29

### Removed

- **SQL Editor — "Execute Query" icon button removed from editor title bar**
  - The `mssqlManager.executeQuery` icon button that appeared in the VS Code editor title bar when a `.sql` file was open has been removed.
  - SQL files open in the custom SQL Editor webview which has its own Run button — the title bar button was redundant and non-functional for the custom editor.

## [0.19.10] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — Quick-script snippets (`table100`, `table*`) and built-in snippets no longer appear inside existing statements**
  - Typing a table name after `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT INTO`, `ALTER TABLE`, `EXEC`, `DROP`, `MERGE`, `CREATE`, or any other SQL keyword previously showed quick-script snippet completions (e.g. `Users100`, `Users*`) that, when accepted, inserted an entire `SELECT TOP 100 * FROM …` statement — producing invalid SQL like `UPDATE SELECT TOP 100 * FROM [dbo].[Users] [u]`.
  - Root cause: snippet suggestions were gated only by a column-focused context check. Statements that had not yet reached a column-focused clause (e.g. `UPDATE ` before `SET`) fell through to the default path, which included all snippets.
  - Fix: added `isCleanStatement()` helper that inspects the current statement fragment (text after the last `;` or start of editor). Quick-script table snippets and all built-in snippets are now suppressed whenever the statement already contains a SQL keyword. Plain table/view/procedure name suggestions remain available in all contexts.
  - Covers all DML/DDL prefixes: `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `EXEC`, `DECLARE`, `MERGE`, `WITH`, and others.

### Tests

- Added **18** unit tests for `isCleanStatement` covering: empty/whitespace input, partial non-keyword words, all major SQL keywords (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `EXEC`, `DECLARE`, `MERGE`, `WITH`), semicolon boundary handling, and case-insensitivity.

## [0.19.9] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **Script ROW DELETE — Composite foreign key WHERE clause now generates valid SQL**
  - Tables with composite foreign keys (e.g. `(MemberId, ProjectId, Role)`) previously generated invalid T-SQL: `WHERE [MemberId, ProjectId, Role] IN (SELECT [MemberId, ProjectId, Role] ...)` — SQL Server does not support multi-column `IN` expressions.
  - Fix: FK columns are now traced through the dependency chain back to the root table's PK. When a column in the dependent table maps to the root PK (e.g. `ProjectMemberToolCapabilities.MemberId` → `Members.Id`), a simple direct `WHERE [MemberId] = @Target_Id` is generated.
  - Level-0 dependencies (tables directly referencing the target) use simple direct `WHERE [col] = @Target_X` comparison.
  - Higher-level dependencies where no FK column traces to root PK fall back to `WHERE EXISTS (...)` with correlated subqueries (composite FK) or `WHERE [col] IN (SELECT ...)` (single-column FK).
  - Extracted reusable `traceColumnsToRoot`, `buildTargetFilter` and `generateDependentDeletes` utilities into `src/utils/deleteScriptGenerator.ts` for testability.

### Tests

- Added **21** unit tests for `deleteScriptGenerator`: `buildTargetFilter` (7 tests), `generateDependentDeletes` (10 tests), and `traceColumnsToRoot` (4 tests) covering direct column tracing, composite FKs, multi-level nesting, deduplication, ordering, circular reference safety, and the original regression case.



## [0.19.8] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

Auto-switch to results (or messages when no rows) when new results arrive.

## [0.19.7] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — Autocomplete suggestions no longer hidden behind result-set sticky header**
  - The "Result Set N" sticky header had `z-index: 200`, placing it above Monaco's autocomplete widget and covering the suggest dropdown.
  - Fix: reduced `.result-set-header` z-index from `200` to `2`.

- **SQL Editor — Autocomplete suggestions no longer covered by grid header row**
  - Monaco renders the suggest (autocomplete) dropdown as an absolutely-positioned overflow widget inside `.monaco-editor` with a built-in z-index of ~40.  Because `.monaco-editor` has no z-index of its own, the suggest widget and our sticky grid elements share the same root stacking context.  Our sticky `<thead>` (z:49) therefore painted on top of the suggest dropdown when it opened downward and overlapped the results panel.
  - Fix: added `z-index: 50 !important` to our `.monaco-editor .suggest-widget` CSS override in `SqlEditor.css`.  This is the only Monaco widget that needs hoisting; hover widgets already use `position: fixed` at z-index 10 000.

- **SQL Editor — Grid sticky header row no longer covered by body cells when scrolling**
  - The `data-grid-table thead` had drifted to `z-index: 2`, which was lower than the body's `row-number-cell` (z:48) and `pinned-cell` (z:40) siblings in the same stacking context — causing row-number column cells to paint *above* the sticky header row during scroll.
  - Fix: restored `thead` z-index to `49` (the established cap for all sticky grid elements).
  - Removed dead `z-index: 100` from `.grid-header` in `GridHeader.css` (always overridden by the more-specific `.data-grid-table thead` rule).

## [0.19.5] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — FROM/SELECT autocomplete now shows schema-qualified names for non-`dbo` tables and views**
  - When typing `SELECT * FROM …` (or any `FROM`/`JOIN` context), tables and views belonging to a schema other than `dbo` (e.g. `SalesLT`, `hr`, `sales`) are now suggested as `[schema].[table]` instead of bare `table`.
  - `dbo` objects continue to be suggested without a schema prefix, matching existing behaviour.
  - Inserting a qualified name produces immediately valid SQL without the user having to manually add the schema.

- **SQL Editor — CTE highlighting and detection no longer fails when a SQL comment precedes `WITH`**
  - CTE names were not detected (and therefore not highlighted or offered in autocomplete) when a line comment (`--`) or block comment (`/* … */`) appeared before the `WITH` keyword without a preceding semicolon.
  - Root cause: the detection regex `^\s*WITH\s+` did not match because it expects only whitespace before `WITH`, and SQL comments are not whitespace.
  - Fix: SQL comments are now stripped before the `WITH` detection in `extractCTEsFromSingleStatement`, `extractCTEsWithColumnsFromSingleStatement` (sqlValidator.ts) and `extractCTEsFromQuery` (sqlCompletionService.ts). String literals are preserved unchanged so comment-like content inside quotes is never accidentally removed.



## [0.19.4] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Stored Procedures — Definition not retrieved when connection is server-level (root cause fix)**
  - All stored procedure commands (`Modify`, `Script as CREATE/ALTER/EXECUTE`, `Execute`, `View Dependencies`, `Rename`, `Delete`, `Properties`) were calling `getConnection()`, which returns the server-level connection pool. That pool is typically connected to `master` (or the server default database), so `OBJECT_ID('dbo.ProcName')` and `sys.procedures` queries silently resolved against the wrong database and returned `NULL`.
  - All commands now use `ensureConnectionAndGetDbPool(connectionId, database)` — the same pattern used by Schema Compare, SQL Chat and the Notebook editor — which guarantees the query runs against the correct database context.
  - This is the true fix behind the *"Could not retrieve procedure definition"* / *"Could not retrieve definition for [...]. Ensure the current user has VIEW DEFINITION permission."* error that appeared even for sysadmin users with no encryption.

## [0.19.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Stored Procedures — Actionable error when definition cannot be retrieved**
  - "Modify" and all "Script as CREATE/ALTER" actions now distinguish between two failure modes instead of showing a generic error:
    - If the procedure was created `WITH ENCRYPTION`, the message reads: *"Procedure [schema].[name] is encrypted — its definition cannot be retrieved."*
    - If the definition is `NULL` for any other reason (e.g. insufficient permissions), the message reads: *"Could not retrieve definition for [schema].[name]. Ensure the current user has VIEW DEFINITION permission."*
  - The `OBJECT_DEFINITION` query now also fetches `OBJECTPROPERTY(..., 'IsEncrypted')` in the same round-trip to determine the cause without an extra query.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Database Explorer — System-versioned (temporal) table support**
  - System-versioned tables now display a distinct sparkle icon (✦) in the database explorer to visually differentiate them from regular tables.
  - The table description now includes a `(system-versioned)` label after the row count and size (e.g. `51 Rows < 1 MB (system-versioned)`).
  - History tables (`temporal_type = 1`) are hidden from the main Tables list — they only appear as a child node when expanding their associated system-versioned table.
  - Expanding a system-versioned table shows a **History** child node (clock icon) pointing to the linked history table with full exploration support: Columns, Indexes, Statistics.
  - Scripting commands (Select Top 1000, Script Table Create, etc.) work on both system-versioned tables and their history child nodes without SQL name escaping issues.
  - Compatible with SQL Server 2008–2014 via automatic fallback query when `temporal_type` column is absent.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Result Grid — Focus stolen by Monaco editor after query execution**
  - Clicking a row or cell in the result grid now explicitly transfers keyboard focus to the grid container, pulling it away from the Monaco SQL editor.
  - Previously, after executing a query, Monaco retained focus even when the user clicked cells in the result set. This caused `Ctrl+C` to copy the SQL text instead of the selected grid cells, and `Ctrl+A` to select SQL text rather than all grid rows.
  - Root cause: `handleCellMouseDown` calls `e.preventDefault()` to suppress browser text-selection during drag operations. This has a side-effect of preventing the browser from naturally moving DOM focus to the clicked element. The fix explicitly calls `gridContainerRef.current?.focus({ preventScroll: true })` inside both `handleCellMouseDown` and `handleRowClick`.


## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **Result Grid — Restructured export/copy menu with submenus**
  - The row-number column header menu now shows three top-level entries: **Auto-fit all columns**, **Copy →**, and **Export →**.
  - **Copy →** submenu appears on hover and contains: Copy to clipboard, Copy as Table, Copy as JSON, Copy as CSV, Copy as TSV, Copy as SQL INSERT, Copy as Markdown, Copy as XML, Copy as HTML. All copy options write directly to the clipboard.
  - **Export →** submenu appears on hover and contains: Export to JSON, Export to CSV, Export to Excel (TSV), Export to SQL INSERT, Export to Markdown, Export to XML, Export to HTML. All export options open a Save As dialog.

- **Result Grid — "Copy as Table" now copies a rich HTML table to clipboard**
  - Uses the `ClipboardItem` API to write two formats simultaneously: `text/html` (a proper `<table>` element) and `text/plain` (markdown table as fallback).
  - Applications that read `text/html` from the clipboard — Teams, Outlook, Word, Confluence, Google Docs, Slack, Discord — will paste a native rendered table instead of ASCII art or raw text.
  - Falls back to plain-text markdown on browsers/environments that do not support `ClipboardItem`.

- **Result Grid — Column filter popup visual style updated**
  - Filter popup now uses `--vscode-menu-*` CSS variables (same as the cell right-click context menu) instead of `--vscode-dropdown-*`. This makes it visually consistent with the rest of the quick-action popups in the result grid.

### Tests

- Added **25** unit tests for `ExportMenu` (submenus, hover, copy/export dispatches, close handlers).
- Added **7** unit tests for `toTableHtml`: `<thead>`/`<tbody>` structure, header cells, data cells, HTML special-character escaping, null/undefined handling, `&` escaping.
- Added **1** unit test for `copyRichTableToClipboard`: verifies `navigator.clipboard.write` is called with a `ClipboardItem` containing both `text/html` and `text/plain` blobs.
- Added **4** unit tests for the ASCII table format in `exportService`.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Interactive Chart Canvas — visualize query results as charts**
  - New **Charts** tab in the Results panel groups all chart widgets on a shared freeform canvas.
  - **Chart configuration dialog**: pick chart type (Bar, Line, Pie, Doughnut, Scatter, Radar), set a title, choose a label column and one or more data columns.
  - Charts can be created directly from the result grid context menu ("Create Chart…").
  - Canvas supports **drag-and-drop** repositioning and **resize handles** (E, S, SE corners) for every widget.
  - **Panning**: drag the canvas background (or use middle-mouse button) to move the viewport.
  - **Zoom controls**: zoom-in / zoom-out / reset buttons in the overlay toolbar plus `Ctrl+Scroll` shortcut.
  - **Text widgets**: add free-form text annotations to the canvas alongside charts.
  - **Widget title editing**: double-click a widget header to rename it inline.
  - **Bring to front**: right-click a widget to raise it above overlapping widgets.
  - **Export**:
    - _HTML_ — self-contained standalone file with embedded Chart.js (no internet required).
    - _SVG_ — vector export of each chart via `canvas.toDataURL`.
    - _PNG_ — raster export of each chart.
  - Full unit-test coverage: `ChartCard`, `ChartConfigDialog`, `ChartPanel`, `ChartPanelNew`, `chartExportService`, `useCanvasWidgets`.

- **Settings — DML Protection tab**
  - The Settings webview now has a dedicated **DML Protection** tab exposing all three protection settings (`warnOnMissingWhere`, `limitAffectedRows`, `maxAffectedRows`) with descriptions.

### Enhanced

- **SQL Validator — improved type inference for SQL functions**
  - `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `ISNULL`, and `COALESCE` expressions now resolve to the underlying column type of their argument (including aliases), providing accurate column-type metadata for chart axis suggestions and cell validation.
  - `DISTINCT` keyword inside aggregate functions is handled transparently.

- **Query Executor — driver-reported column type fallback**
  - Computed columns (`COUNT(*)`, `MAX(col)`, `SUM(col)`, etc.) that cannot be resolved by schema introspection now fall back to the type declaration reported directly by the SQL driver, improving type accuracy for chart data column selection.

- **SQL Chat Handler — stable conversation IDs**
  - Conversation ID generation now uses a deterministic hash across the session lifetime, preventing ID drift that could break multi-turn SQL chat continuity.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **DML Protection — Warn on missing WHERE clause**
  - New setting `mssqlManager.dmlProtection.warnOnMissingWhere` (default: `true`).
  - Before executing a batch that contains `UPDATE` or `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause, a modal confirmation dialog is shown asking the user to confirm execution.

- **DML Protection — Affected-row limit check**
  - New setting `mssqlManager.dmlProtection.limitAffectedRows` (default: `true`).
  - New setting `mssqlManager.dmlProtection.maxAffectedRows` (default: `100`).
  - Before executing `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, the statement is run inside a rolled-back transaction to count affected rows. If the count exceeds `maxAffectedRows`, a confirmation dialog is shown with the exact number.
  - The dry-run transaction is always rolled back and is **not** recorded in query history.

## [0.16.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Result Grid — Free-range cell selection (Excel-style)**
  - Cells can now be selected by clicking and dragging across any rectangular region, just like Excel.
  - The selection anchor is set on `mousedown`; every subsequent `mouseenter` while the button is held live-extends the selection rectangle without changing the anchor.
  - Releasing the mouse button anywhere (inside or outside the grid) ends the drag.
  - Shift+click on a cell extends the existing selection rectangle from the current anchor to the clicked cell.
  - Ctrl+click on a cell adds or removes individual cells from the selection (non-contiguous multi-select).

### Fixed

- **Result Grid — Browser text-selection highlight during Shift+click / drag**
  - Holding Shift and clicking, or dragging across cells, previously caused the browser to render the native blue text-selection highlight over cell content.
  - `user-select: none` is now always applied to the grid container (instead of only during mouse drag), completely suppressing OS text selection while keeping cell highlight styles intact.

- **Result Grid — "Copy Row" renamed to "Copy Selection"**
  - The context-menu entry that copies the active selection was labelled _Copy Row_, which was misleading when multiple rows or a multi-cell range were selected.
  - It is now labelled **Copy Selection** everywhere it appears (row right-click, cell right-click, and the `buildCellMenuItems` helper).


## [0.16.6] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor React — Mixed-bracket object notation no longer produces false validation errors**
  - Queries using a mix of bracketed and unbracketed schema/table identifiers (e.g. `dbo.[Table]` or `[dbo].Table`) were incorrectly flagged as *"Invalid object name 'db'"* due to a regex backtracking bug.
  - Root cause: the bare-identifier pattern `([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(?!\s*\.)` could backtrack and match a truncated prefix of the schema name (e.g. `db` from `dbo`) because the negative lookahead passed for the shorter match.
  - Fixed by adding a word-boundary assertion `\b` after the captured identifier token, preventing partial-word matches.
  - Added two new regex patterns to explicitly handle the mixed-bracket forms `schema.[Table]` and `[schema].Table`, so these references are correctly parsed and validated instead of falling through to the bare-identifier pattern.
  - Fix applied to both `findTableReferences` (validation markers) and `extractTableAliasMap` (column validation alias resolution).

### Tests

- Added **7** unit tests covering mixed-bracket notation and the regression:
  - `findTableReferences` — `schema.[Table]`, `[schema].Table`, backtracking regression guard, multi-JOIN mixed-bracket query.
  - `validateSql` — no markers for `dbo.[Table]`, `[dbo].Table`, and a multi-JOIN query that previously produced a spurious `'db'` error.

## [0.16.5] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **SQL variable highlighting — false positives inside string literals**
  - The `@variable` highlighting regex was incorrectly matching `@`-signs inside single-quoted SQL string literals (e.g. `'some@domain.net'`), causing tokens like `@domain` to be highlighted as if they were SQL variables.
  - Added a `getSqlStringRanges` helper that pre-scans the query text for all single-quoted string ranges (including `N'...'` Unicode literals and `''` escaped quotes) before applying decorations. Any `@` match whose position falls inside a quoted string is now skipped.


## [0.16.4] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **SQL Editor React — Custom CSS validation tooltips**
  - Replaced native browser `title` attribute with styled CSS tooltip that appears centered above the cell on hover, with a downward-pointing arrow, error border, and smooth opacity transition.

- **SQL Editor React — Validation errors in Pending Changes tab**
  - Per-row and per-cell commit buttons are disabled when their corresponding cells have validation errors.
  - Validation error messages are shown inline in both single-change and expanded multi-change views with a ⚠ icon.
  - "Commit All" button tooltip changes to indicate errors must be fixed first.

### Tests

- Added **8** unit tests for PendingChangesTab validation error display, button disabling, and error message rendering.
- Updated GridCell and InlineEditing tests for custom tooltip span (replacing `title` attribute checks).

## [0.16.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **SQL Editor React — Data-type validation on cell edit**
  - When a cell value is edited and committed (blur / Enter / Tab), the new value is validated against the column’s SQL Server data type (`int`, `bigint`, `smallint`, `tinyint`, `decimal`, `numeric`, `float`, `real`, `money`, `smallmoney`, `bit`, `date`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, `datetimeoffset`, `time`, `uniqueidentifier`).
  - `NULL` values are always accepted; empty strings are treated as `NULL`.
  - If the value is invalid the cell’s outline and corner triangle turn **red** (uses `--vscode-inputValidation-errorBorder`) and the error description is shown as a native tooltip on hover.
  - **Commit All** and per-cell commit buttons are disabled while any validation error exists.
  - Validation logic is extracted into a standalone utility (`utils/cellValidation.ts`) to keep `GridCell.tsx` minimal.

### Changed

- **SQL Editor React — JSON/XML cell colors are now theme-aware by default**
  - Removed the previous fallback (`--vscode-textPreformat-foreground`).
  - Default color is now `#ce9178` (dark theme) / `#a31515` (light theme) when no custom color is configured.

- **SQL Editor React — Modified-cell triangle indicator enlarged**
  - Corner triangle increased from 7×7 px to 10×10 px for better visibility.

### Tests

- Added **37** unit tests for `validateCellValue` covering all SQL types, boundary values, empty-string-as-NULL passthrough, and invalid-format rejection.
- Added **5** unit tests for GridCell validation-error state:
  - `validation-error` class presence/absence depending on `isModified` and `validationError`.
  - Tooltip shows error message on hover.
  - Long-text title still displayed when no validation error.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor React — Modified cell indicator: triangle corner instead of dot**
  - Cells with pending changes no longer have their background color altered.
  - The previous dot (`●`) in the top-right corner is replaced by a small triangle clipped to the top-right corner of the cell (CSS `::after` pseudo-element, same amber color).
  - An amber outline border is drawn around the entire modified cell for additional visibility.

- **SQL Editor React — JSON objects now display correctly in view mode**
  - When a query result column contains a JSON object that has been pre-parsed by the `mssql` driver (i.e. the value arrives as a JavaScript object rather than a string), the cell previously rendered `[object Object]`.
  - The display value is now produced via `JSON.stringify()`, the cell receives the `json` CSS class, and the _Open in editor_ button is shown — matching the behaviour already in place for JSON string values and JSON arrays.


## [0.16.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **SQL Editor React — quick open for JSON/XML cell values in Result Grid**
  - JSON and XML values in result cells now show a hover action icon in the top-right corner of the cell.
  - Clicking the icon opens the full cell content in a new VS Code editor tab next to the SQL editor.
  - JSON payloads are formatted before opening for better readability.

### Tests

- Added unit tests for JSON/XML quick-open action in `GridCell`:
  - button visibility for JSON and XML values,
  - no button for plain text values,
  - `openInNewEditor` message payload verification for both JSON and XML.

## [0.16.0]

### Added

- **SQL Editor React — Data-type-aware column filters**
  - Filter popup now adapts to the SQL column type, showing only relevant filter options per category.
  - **Text** (varchar, nvarchar, char, text, …): Contains, Does not contain, Equals, Not equals, Starts with, Ends with, Regex, In (select values), Is NULL / Is not NULL. Includes a case-sensitive toggle.
  - **Number** (int, bigint, decimal, float, money, …): Equals, Not equals, Greater than, Less than, Between, Is NULL / Is not NULL.
  - **Date** (datetime, datetime2, date, datetimeoffset, …): Equals, Before, After, Between, Is NULL / Is not NULL with native datetime-local inputs.
  - **Boolean** (bit): Radio-button selection for True / False / NULL.
  - **GUID** (uniqueidentifier): Equals, Not equals, Contains, In (select values), Is NULL / Is not NULL.
  - **Binary / spatial** (varbinary, image, geography, geometry, hierarchyid): Is NULL / Is not NULL only.
  - **XML / JSON**: Is NULL / Is not NULL only.
  - **IN filter**: Checkbox-based multi-select with search, Select all / Deselect all, and selected-count display. Available for text and GUID columns (up to 500 distinct values).

### Tests

- Added 87 unit tests covering all filter categories, IN filter interactions, filter state restore, and `getColumnFilterCategory()` type mapping.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor React — `@@ROWCOUNT` / `@@TRANCOUNT` no longer highlighted as local variables**
  - Variable decorations now ignore T-SQL system variables prefixed with `@@`, so only real local variables such as `@ProjectToolsInserted` receive the configured variable color.

- **SQL Editor React — `Ctrl+V` / `Ctrl+X` only handled when text focus is in the editor**
  - Clipboard shortcuts are now restricted to Monaco's text-focus context.
  - This prevents the editor from intercepting paste/cut while the Find widget input is focused.

- **SQL Editor React — autocomplete resets correctly after `;`**
  - Context analysis now evaluates only the current SQL statement fragment after the last statement terminator.
  - When the cursor is after a completed statement and there is no active clause yet, autocomplete shows the expected global suggestions again, including table quick snippets such as `Users100` / `Users*`.

- **SQL Editor React — Go to Definition for SQL variables**
  - Added Monaco definition provider support for local SQL variables.
  - `F12` / `Ctrl+Click` on usages like `@ProjectToolsInserted` now navigates to the `DECLARE @ProjectToolsInserted ...` definition.

### Tests

- Added unit coverage for skipping `@@system` variable highlights.
- Added unit coverage for clipboard shortcut focus gating in Monaco actions.
- Added unit coverage for autocomplete suggestions after a semicolon-terminated statement.
- Added unit coverage for SQL variable go-to-definition resolution and provider registration.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **SQL Editor — "Show Multiple Result Sets" setting**
  - New `mssqlManager.multipleResultSetsDisplay` VS Code setting and corresponding **Show Multiple Result Sets** dropdown in the Query Editor tab of the Settings webview.
  - **Single view** (default): all result sets are rendered stacked, exactly as before.
  - **Separately**: when a query returns 2 or more result sets, a compact tab bar (_Set 1_, _Set 2_, …) appears above the grid. Only the selected result set is shown. If there is only one result set, the tab bar is hidden automatically.

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — `@variable` highlight now uses foreground (text) color**
  - Previously, enabling the _Highlight Variables Color_ setting applied a semi-transparent background to `@variable` tokens. It now sets the **text color**, making variables readable against any editor background.

- **SQL Editor — T-SQL type keywords correctly colorized**
  - `NVARCHAR`, `NCHAR`, `NTEXT`, `DATETIME`, `DATETIME2`, `DATETIMEOFFSET`, `SMALLDATETIME`, `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`, `ROWVERSION`, `TINYINT`, `BIGINT`, `VARBINARY`, `IMAGE`, `XML`, `SQL_VARIANT`, `HIERARCHYID`, `GEOGRAPHY`, `GEOMETRY`, `MONEY`, `SMALLMONEY` now receive the same blue keyword color as `INT` and `VARCHAR`.
  - Root cause: Monaco's SQL language has no `typeKeywords` array — all data-type identifiers live in the flat `keywords` list. Our previous extension was targeting a non-existent property.

### Tests

- Added 5 unit tests for the _separately_ result-sets display mode in `ResultsPanel.test.tsx`.
- Updated 2 `useVariableHighlight` tests to check `color:` (foreground) instead of `background:`.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **SQL Editor — "Highlight Variables Color" setting**
  - New `mssqlManager.variableHighlightColor` VS Code setting and corresponding **Highlight Variables Color** control in the Query Editor tab of the Settings webview.
  - When enabled, all `@variable` tokens in the SQL editor are highlighted with a configurable background color (default `#6adc7a`).
  - Color picker includes a native color input, hex text field, and live preview swatch.

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor — T-SQL type keywords colorization**
  - `NVARCHAR`, `NCHAR`, `NTEXT`, `DATETIME2`, `DATETIMEOFFSET`, `SMALLDATETIME`, `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`, `HIERARCHYID`, `GEOGRAPHY`, `GEOMETRY`, `ROWVERSION`, `TIMESTAMP`, `SQL_VARIANT`, `XML`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `BIGINT`, `MONEY`, `SMALLMONEY`, `REAL`, `IMAGE`, `BINARY`, `VARBINARY` and others now receive the correct `type` token color in the Monaco SQL editor, matching the behavior of `INT` and `VARCHAR`.

- **SQL Editor — `COUNT(*)` no longer triggers wildcard expansion**
  - `COUNT(*)`, `SUM(*)`, and any `func(*)` pattern no longer show the "Expand `*` → N columns" CodeLens action, and pressing TAB after `*` inside parentheses no longer attempts a column expansion.

- **Results panel — auto-navigate to Query Plan tab after "Get Estimated Execution Plan"**
  - After running "Get Estimated Execution Plan," the Results panel now automatically switches to the **Query Plan** tab so the plan is immediately visible without a manual click.

- **Results panel — scrolling with 5+ result sets**
  - When a query returns more than ~3 result sets, the outer results container now scrolls vertically, making all result grids accessible.

### Tests

- Added 6 unit tests for `COUNT(*)`/function-wildcard suppression in `sqlWildcardService.test.ts`.
- Added 3 unit tests for Query Plan tab auto-navigation in `ResultsPanel.test.tsx`.
- Added 9 unit tests for `useVariableHighlight` hook in `useVariableHighlight.test.ts`.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Result Grid — Color Primary / Foreign Keys setting now working in React editor**
  - Fixed: the "Color Primary / Foreign Keys" toggle in Settings was saved but had no effect on the React-based SQL Editor result grid.
  - `GridCell` now reads `colorPrimaryForeignKeys` from the editor config and conditionally applies `pk-cell` (gold) / `fk-cell` (blue) CSS classes and the expand chevron.

- **Result Grid — Number Format setting**
  - New `mssqlManager.numberFormat` VS Code setting and corresponding **Number Format** dropdown in the Query Editor tab of the Settings webview.
  - Options: **Plain** (default, raw `toString()`), **Locale** (locale-aware thousand separators), **2 decimal places**, **4 decimal places**.
  - Setting is applied live to all numeric cells in query results without reloading the editor.

### Tests

- Added 16 unit tests in `GridCell.config.test.tsx` covering:
  - `colorPrimaryForeignKeys: true/false` — pk-cell / fk-cell class presence and expand chevron visibility for both PK and FK columns.
  - All four `numberFormat` values — plain, locale, fixed-2, fixed-4 — including integer padding and decimal rounding.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **SQL Editor React — Monaco Theme Color Format (Cursor Compatibility)**
  - Fixed "Illegal value for token color: rgba(...)" error when opening SQL Editor in Cursor and other VS Code forks.
  - Root cause: Cursor's VS Code CSS variables like `--vscode-editor-foreground` return `rgba()` format instead of hex. Monaco's `defineTheme` `colors` map only accepts hex format (`#RRGGBB` / `#RRGGBBAA`).
  - Solution: Added `cssColorToHex()` utility that converts any CSS color format (hex, rgb, rgba, named colors) to Monaco-compatible hex using browser-native color parsing.
  - All 4 SQL theme definitions now use `cssVarHex()` for reading editor colors, ensuring compatibility across VS Code, VS Code Insiders, and Cursor.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **New Connection — Parse Connection String: Auto-detect Windows Authentication**
  - When parsing a connection string that contains no username (e.g. `Server=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=master;Trusted_Connection=Yes;`), the Authentication Type field is now automatically set to **Windows Authentication** instead of remaining on the SQL Server Authentication default.
  - Added support for the `Trusted_Connection=Yes/True` key in the connection string parser (previously only `Integrated Security=True/SSPI` was recognised).
  - Fallback rule: if the parsed connection string contains neither a `User ID` nor an explicit auth-type flag, the form now defaults to Windows Authentication.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **SQL Notebook — Clear Results**
  - Added per-cell "Clear results" icon button (✕) on the right side of result sets, visible on hover over the output area.
  - Added "Clear All Results" button in the main notebook toolbar, visible only when at least one cell has results.
  - Clearing results removes both successful result sets and error messages.

- **SQL Notebook — Delayed Markdown Toolbar**
  - Markdown cell edit/preview toolbar now appears with a 500ms hover delay instead of instantly, reducing visual noise when scrolling.

- **Notebooks Tree — Section Management**
  - Added "New Section..." context action on notebook root folders to create subfolders for organizing notebooks.
  - Empty sections (folders) are now shown in the Notebooks tree view, enabling folder-first organization workflows.
  - "Add notebook" (➕) inline action available on both root folders and sections.
  - Hidden directories (dot-prefixed) remain filtered out.

- **Notebooks Tree — Root Notebook Creation**
  - The "+" button in the Notebooks view title now creates a root notebook as a folder with a `_config.yml` file defining the notebook name.
  - The created folder is automatically registered and displayed in the Notebooks tree view.
  - Inline "+" on folders/sections still creates `.ipynb` files as before.

### Changed

- **Notebooks Tree — Subfolder Visibility**
  - All non-hidden subfolders are now displayed in the tree view regardless of whether they contain notebooks, supporting the new section-based organization.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-08

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Schema Compare - SQL Session Kill State Recovery**
  - Fixed issue where Schema Compare could fail with SQL Server error: "Cannot continue the execution because the session is in the kill state".
  - Added automatic retry flow for kill-state failures by resetting database-scoped pools and retrying comparison.
  - Added safe-mode fallback for metadata loading (sequential queries instead of aggressive parallel loading) to improve resilience on unstable sessions.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Settings Webview Command Integration**
  - Added **Open settings** action to Database Explorer **More Actions** menu (three-dot menu), placed at the top.

    - `dataTypeCase`
    - `functionCase`
    - `linesBetweenQueries`
    - `indentStyle`
    - `logicalOperatorNewline`

  - Updated boolean setting layout to use separate columns: switch column + name/description column.
  - Removed explicit Save/Reset buttons and introduced **auto-save on change**.
  - Added subtle visual indication for values changed from defaults.

- **Settings Architecture**
  - Refactored settings form fields into dedicated components:
    - `BooleanSetting`
    - `NumberSetting`
    - `SelectSetting`
  - Moved shared settings contracts/defaults to a separate `types` module.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Backup Import — Suggest New Name**: The "Suggest New Name" button now derives the base name from the selected `.bak` filename when the backup has not yet been analyzed (or analysis returned no metadata), instead of falling back to the generic `MyDatabase` placeholder.
- **Backup Import — Target Database auto-fill**: Selecting a `.bak` file now automatically populates the Target Database field with the filename (without extension) when the field is empty.
- **Backup Import — SQL Server accessible staging path**: Backup files copied for SQL Server access are now staged under `<SYSTEMDRIVE>\Temp\sql-backup-restore` (e.g. `D:\Temp\...`) instead of the hardcoded `C:\Temp\...`, ensuring compatibility on systems where the OS is not installed on `C:`.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **New Query (Untitled Mode)**: "New Query" no longer creates temporary `.sql` files on disk. Instead, it opens a lightweight untitled SQL editor webview with full query execution support.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Related Tables Expansion with Windows Authentication**: Fixed "No related data found" when expanding related tables on connections using Windows Auth (e.g. SQL Express / LocalDB)
  - Root cause: the expansion query was prefixed with `USE [database];` even though the connection pool was already scoped to the correct database. The `msnodesqlv8` driver (used for Windows Auth) materialises `USE` as a separate empty result set, causing the UI to read `resultSets[0]` (empty) instead of `resultSets[1]` (actual data).
  - Backend fix: removed the redundant `USE [database];` prefix from relation expansion queries — the pool created by `createDbPool` already targets the correct database.
  - Frontend fix: `handleRelationResults` now picks the **first non-empty** result set rather than always using index 0, providing a safety net for any driver that may still emit auxiliary result sets.


## [0.11.3] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- **Local Server Discovery Check**: Re-enabled the check to skip local server discovery if it has already been executed, preventing unnecessary repeated discovery attempts on Windows systems.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **NULL Value Handling in Result Grid Updates**: Fixed issue where typing "null" in a cell would generate `SET column = 'NULL'` instead of `SET column = NULL`
  - Typing "null" (case-insensitive) in a cell now correctly generates SQL NULL value
  - Typing "'null'" (with quotes) also generates SQL NULL value
  - Prevents incorrect string literal 'NULL' from being inserted into database columns
  - Affects all UPDATE statements generated from editable result grids

## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Font Customization Support**: Comprehensive font configuration for SQL editor and result grids
